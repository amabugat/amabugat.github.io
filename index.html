                            <p id = "aboutDesc" style = "padding-bottom: 20vh;"> I also have an abundant amount of leadership experience, holding positions in two clubs - Circle K International (part of the Kiwanis Family) and Bayanihan for the past three years. I am currently the president of one of my clubs, Bayanihan. Additionally, I received an award as "Distinguished Secretary" for my role in  Circle K International.
