                            <p id = "aboutDesc">I am currently a student at UC Santa Cruz. I am a third year engineering major, with a concentration in Systems Programming. 
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p id = "aboutDesc"> While I am experienced in Java, C++, and other languages, I am always eager to learn new languages and softwares. I do a lot of independent projects, mostly catered towards graphic design, website making, or video editing for the clubs I am a part of.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p id = "aboutDesc" style = "padding-bottom: 20vh;"> I also have an abundant amount of leadership experience, holding positions in two clubs - Circle K International (part of the Kiwanis Family) and Bayanihan for the past three years. I am currently the president of one of my clubs, Bayanihan. Additionally, I received an award as "Distinguished Secretary" for my role in  Circle K International.
